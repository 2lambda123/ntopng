How to Contribute
=================

Anyone is welcome to contribute through the official repository
on github:

  git clone -b dev https://github.com/ntop/ntopng.git

If you want to contribute with a patch, the first step to get it
in the main tree is to run the regression tests included in the 
ntopng source code. 

Run the Tests
=============

An automated test suite is available under ntopng/tests, in order
to run it, compile ntopng and run the run.sh script:

  cd ntopng/tests
  ./run.sh

Please check that all the tests complete successfully before moving
to the next step, sending the Pull Request.

Create a PR
===========

Please check the official GitHub documentation for instructions
for sending Pull Requests:

  https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request

After the submission the ntop core team will review the patches to
make sure they are well written and do the right things. If everything
goes well, patches are applied to the dev branch and will be included
in the nightly builds.
