## Data-rate units

Data-transfer rate is the average number of bits (_bitrate_) per unit time passing through a communication link. ntopng uses **data rate units** that are multiples of bits per second (_bit/s_) and bytes per second (_B/s_).

In the context of data-rate units, one byte consists of 8 bits, and is synonymous with the unit octet, so that _1 Mbit/s_ (one million bits per second) is _0.125 MB/s_ (megabyte per second).

According to the SI unit rules and style conventions, ntopng uses a solidus (i.e., _slash_) to signify the [division of units](https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/checklist.html). The abbreviation _bps_, although acceptable, is not used to mean _bit/s_ in ntopng.
